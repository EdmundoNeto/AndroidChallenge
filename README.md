# AndroidChallenge

AIS Android Challenge

If you're here, it means that you intend to be part of our team.

## Some Rules

1 - **DO NOT** share this repository or your answer with others - forks aren't allowed here.

2 - Remember that this challenge it's meant to evaluate your skills, you don't necessarily have to finish **all** the challenge code implementation, we are evaluating your coding skiils.

## Advices

- Clone the repository.
- Create a feature branch (from dev branhc) with the following pattern:
  Use your name as branch name, eg:
  Considering that my name is Guilherme Prado the branch name should be: "feature/guilherme_prado"
- Work **only** on your branch, and after you finish, create a Pull Request to "dev" branch.
- **DO NOT** change the reviewers of your Pull Request.
- If you need to do a network call on the challenge, use the following Endpoint: https://nba-teams-3306.getsandbox.com/.
  It's a single GET call which retrieves some JSON data, feel free to use it.
